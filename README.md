1st round technical interview question. Wasnt completed within the hour. 

## Potential Improvements: 
- Display an error or red border around the tile when a user inputs the wrong number
- "Learning mode" which highlights the tile/s that share a value with the users input in that col/row/square
- Move from 4x4 to 9x9
